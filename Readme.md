# Introduction
This is a cat toy for when the owner is away. It has a camera, microcontroller, image recognition, and servo motor. Install it on the ceiling with a feather toy below that moves 180 degrees. The camera spots the cat, adjusting the feathers based on its moves. Future versions might let the owner control it remotely using a smartphone.
